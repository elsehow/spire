problems:

- something is not quite right with the date scaling....
  this should be 1 unified module IMO

- date rollovers on the ESMS api...why does that happen?
  whats going on with the timezones in the spire API, 
  hows that different from what i'm doing with ESMS?

- something is not quite right with the date scaling....
  this should be 1 unified module IMO	

- times, sometimes i do *1000, sometimes not
  ......should be ALL SAME preferably NO *1000 at all

- DOM management ,, ?  i have all these jquery selectors, and thats lame


questions:

- does UNIX epoch have a timezone?
  are epochs the same or different between spire+ESMS?
  (assume same,but how different,why is querying differnet?)

- how do pixels map to times?
  how do pixels map to *unix* times?
  what is being mapped? time, start, max, containerSize?
  what is being held constant across all places with a scaling function?
  what are possible points of impercision?


solve those too@!

orders of investigation:

- how are times formatted from Spire API?
  how are times formatted from ESMs API?
  hopefully they are identical by the time they hit index.js!

- how do pixels map to UNIX times?
  what are sources of imprecision?

- what is the relationship between DOM and state? 
  when is DOM being rendered? how is it generated?







wishlist:
  paper version
  global timescale at the bottom st
  drag and delete graphs
  would be cool to play with moves...just in general
