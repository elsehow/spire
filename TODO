how to deploy esms?


deploy esms
collect spire+eeg data
in a 'vacuum' (kefir.ajax?)
	, send a date-based request...
	, establish minimum+maximum times....


how to establish a global min/max time?
...
are times really synchronized?
does it "work" (look good)?
refactor







there should be a global timescale...
drag and delete graphs
would be cool to play with moves...just in general
keep goin on it
